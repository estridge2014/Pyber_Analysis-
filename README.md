# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis 

Pyber is a python based ride sharing app. In previous analysis, I used python and pandas to examine data from large CSV files (city_data.csv and ride_data.csv). These files contain ridesharing data from urban, suburban, and rural cities. ride_data.csv includes data of specific rides, the cities they occured in, the fare and the ride id number. The city_data_csv included data on each individual city, it's type and it's number of drivers. In the exploratory stage of the analysis, I inspected the data and determined the average ride count, fare, and average number of drivers for each city type.
