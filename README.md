# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis 

Pyber is a python based ride sharing app. In previous analysis, I used python and pandas to examine data from large CSV files (city_data.csv and ride_data.csv). These files contain ridesharing data from urban, suburban, and rural cities. ride_data.csv includes data of specific rides, the cities they occured in, the fare and the ride id number. The city_data_csv included data on each individual city, it's type and it's number of drivers. In the exploratory stage of the analysis, I inspected the data and determined the average ride count, fare, and average number of drivers for each city type. Then, using matplotlib I created visualization of the data, through line graphs, bar graphs, pie graphs, scatter plots and box and whisker plots. This analysis is contained in the pyber.ipynb file which has been uploaded to this repository.  

For the pyber analysis challenge, I am using similar methods to continue analyzing these datasets to create a summary dataframe of the ride sharing data by city type. Then, using pandas and Matplotlib I have created data visualizations that show the average ride fare per week for each type of city. This analysis will show how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. I will be summarizing my findings below.
